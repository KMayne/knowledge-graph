Ideas:
* Add some kind of navigation for switching to different graphs
* Add directional relationships
* Allow visual transformations
* Other data types e.g. list (could be encoded in named relationship as linked list)
* Add node sidebar

Node sidebar
* Edit node data
* View path?
* View virtual layer membership (where applicable)
* View related nodes
